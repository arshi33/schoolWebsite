<p><font color="#333333"><br><br>For the wheels of progress to keep on rolling ahead, it is mandatory that the educational institutions of a progressive and vibrant nation keep pace with the changing times and cater to the needs of the contemporary society. One such ever-evolving, premier co-educational institution of Uttarakhand, which has maintained the tradition of excellent academic results as well as opened new vistas in tune with 21st century for the holistic development of its students, is DPS Ranipur, Haridwar. With an All India Character, it is an amalgam of industrial ethos of the great technological giants Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited and the educational giants Delhi Public School Society. Situated at Ranipur in Hardwar, it is the first ever venture of DPS Society outside Delhi. 
<br><br>
Spread over an area of 60 acres, nestled in the foothills of the Shivalik Range and pollution free atmosphere of Ranipur, with the Holy Ganga flowing in the vicinity – ours is a co-educational, English medium school affiliated to CBSE. Established in 1977, the school provides quality education to children from Prep-Jr. to Class XII, offering Science, Commerce and Humanities streams at +2 level. We believe in creating an ambience for learning where the multi-faceted growth of a child’s personality is possible in a natural and smooth manner. 
<br><br>
To cater to the needs of its ever-increasing number of students (presently, around 5300), the school has been adding to its existing infrastructure. With the functioning of the new Middle Wing of the school from July 2006, the school is proud to have 3 well stocked libraries; separate fully equipped science laboratories in the Junior, Middle & Senior Wings; 3 modern computer labs. The school has a state-of-the-art Language Lab with facilities for e-education and it is one of its kinds in the neighbouring areas. Two extremely spacious Activity Halls in the Pre-Primary and the Middle Wing and a Skating Rink in the Middle Wing are the star attraction of the school. A new stable for 10 horses and dormitories (for 10 persons) for the horse – trainers and security guards has been constructed. 
<br><br>
The school has introduced a number of activities and competitions in the Activity Clubs, keeping in mind the career options of tomorrow. ENGLISH ANCHORING, ENGLISH / HINDI NEWS READING, MATHEMATICS ONLINE QUIZ and COMPUTER AD DESIGNING are just a few to name. 
<br><br>
Well-maintained play grounds, courts for various games, 12 Activity Clubs (including Horse Riding), two beautiful art rooms and three music rooms reflect the ambitions of school in the fields of sports and extra-curricular activities. 
<br><br>
The school is abuzz with activities even in Summer Holidays and Summer Coaching Camps are organized in several games like Athletics, Basketball, Badminton, Hockey, Cricket, Football, Tai-kwon-do, Horse Riding and Yoga Camps for Parents. The chief attraction is the coaching in swimming for the tiny-tots in the Splash Pool of the Pre-Primary wing. Adventure Camps organized in winters are also a unique feature of the school. 
<br><Inculcating healthy social and moral values, qualities of head and heart and sensitizing students to the needs of society and environment hold paramount importance in the life of Free WIll School. The school organized ‘River-Yatra’ in April 2003 to sensitize masses to havoc caused to our rivers due to pollution. Our students actively participate in programmes related to Aids and Pulse Polio. We inculcate the mantra of ‘Caring and Sharing’ and students generously lend their helping hand - be it for Helpage India, Earthquake or floods. 
<br><br>
Free will School is the only school to have adopted the practice of e-result and declaring school result since 2005 session on its website www.dpshardwar.com. Through Internet the students, parents and Principal can directly communicate with each other. Information related to any school activity can be accessed with the click of a mouse from the school website. Our school publishes e-magazine every month. Online contribution can be received from students, teachers, parents and alumni. We don’t waste paper and not using printer. This comes under carbon free & eco friendly form. Parents of senior students are sent attendance everyday in the early hours within 15 minutes from the actual arrival time using SMS services. Weekly test, monthly test, term test reports are sent to each parent on his mobile using centralized SMS services. School uses all high-tech mode & appliances for communication purpose. 
<br><br>
With a trained and dedicated faculty, clearly defined road-map for future, the motto ‘Service Before Self’ and quest for excellence and quality in every aspect of education, Free will School is poised for a quantum leap forward and attain enormous success in the years ahead.
